# VIProject - Kinect Training Set Visualisation in VB.NET (No Longer Updated)

## Project Description
This VB.NET project is designed to provide a visualisation toolkit for Kinect camera data. It is aimed at processing and displaying RGB, depth, and infrared (IR) video streams, suitable for research and development in the field of visual intelligence.

## Prerequisites
- .NET Framework (Version corresponding to your development environment)
- A compatible library for video processing in VB.NET
- Kinect SDK for Windows (if interfacing with Kinect hardware)

## Setup and Installation
1. Ensure you have the .NET Framework installed.
2. Install the Kinect SDK from the official Microsoft website.
3. Set up a new VB.NET project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio/Spyder via Anaconda).
4. Add references to any required libraries or SDKs in your project.

## Building the Application
- Use Visual Studio or your preferred VB.NET environment to build the application.
- Configure the necessary project properties.
- Inlcude your own videos to use 

## Usage
- The application can be started from the Visual Studio IDE or by running the built executable.
- Command-line arguments can be handled using `My.Application.CommandLineArgs`.

## Features
- Interface for playing back Kinect camera footage.
- Display options for various video streams.
